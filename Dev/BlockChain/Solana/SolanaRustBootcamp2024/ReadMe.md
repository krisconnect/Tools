# Encode bootcamp solana/rust 2024 :)
First ever exposure to solana/rust! :)

### My experience
Everything rust felt very well put together, really enjoyed working with it, in love with the language 10/10.
The solana-cli ðŸ¤¯Really fast, felt amazing to create accounts, mint tokens, send sol 9/10.
Client side stuff...what a struggle...need to up my javascript by a lot 4/10...
Solana...janky af...spent most of my time trying to figure out issues and cryptic error messages... 2/10.
Exercises and hands-on experience 3/10. I really wanted to see solutions, live coding, more exercises and 101 coding support.
Community: 2/10 because that's how many people I actually had a chat from 130.
Overall 5/10: I've mostly learned on my own, but I never needed help with that. I was really looking forward to interacting with people and collaborating which would've been the real value to me...
## Final project
### Idea 1: Werewolf game
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jKf3bviyAmgPHSyUBnA_X8oEpJMBHbdjmXTlK_28rO8/edit#slide=id.p
Would've needed a lot more time to finish :(
### Idea 2: Hashvault
A hashvault to help digital creators gain an additional layer of ownership over their products!
A hashvault can be used when disputes around proof of ownership arise:
The user uploads a hash of their digital product with a seed of their choice to be stored on chain. A proof of ownership can be provided by running the hash function again and cross-referencing it with the on-chain seeded value.
